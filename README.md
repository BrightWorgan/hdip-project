# Aim: 
 
The primary aim of this project is to simplify archaeological paperwork in order to both safeguard priceless information and reduce waste on excavation sites while simultaneously enforcing standards and following heritage regulations. 

 

# Scope: 
 
As an inordinate amount of archaeological work involves paperwork, the possible scope of this project could easily be increased, however, to not only achieve the goals set below and to meet the project deadline set by TU,  I would like to narrow the scope of this project to one area of paperwork. This area is also probably the most important and most used on an everyday basis so it would be an excellent deliverable to achieve. 

 

# Goals: 
 
There are two primary goals to this project. 

1. To develop a minimum viable product based on my idea of supporting an extremely paper-heavy field of study and work. 
 

2. To learn a new technology that is currently being used and is sought after in the software development field. 



# Project deliverables: 
 

Minimum Viable Product consisting of several key sections; 

    Mobile application, (Backend and Frontend) 

    Web application, (Backend and Frontend) 

    Api 

    Unit tests 

    Intergration Testing

    End-to-end testing plan and report 

    Use case demo with accurate sample/demo data and users 


# Technologies Used: 

Backend: 

    TypeScript / Node JS – a superset of JavaScript 

Frontend: 

    React 

Mobile: 

    React Native  

End-to-end Testing: 

    Playwright (through TypeScript)  

Tools: 

    Git (will be using Git hub#0 

    Jira and Sprint Retro tool? 


# Design: 
 

    Mobile -first? Or definitely mobile-friendly 

    Colour blind friendly 

    Easy to use 

    Follow standard design principles 

    Keep the design and styling consistent throughout all of both the Web application as well as the Mobile application. 

    Follow clean code practices 

    security focused on project data 
    authentication: through API password hashing, assault (adds a unique numeric code to the end of a user’s password à anti-hacking ), script/ memory hard 
    Redundancy: scheduled database backups, multi-AZ (multi availability zones à lookup)  

 

# Workflow: 
 

    Agile vs Waterfall – seeing as this is an individual project, and I have worked as part of an Agile team during my 6 month internship, the intention for this project is to follow an Agile Workflow as much as possible. 
     

    GitHub – the project repository will be hosted on a GitHub Repo, and will have commits added to it every day either as a feature has been created or as an issue has been resolved or at the end of the day. 

 

# Proposed System Architecture: 


Api – a Restful API, using the “Express” 

Web Application – with both a Frontend and Backend, using the “Vite” build tool, and written in React for the Front end and ___ for the Backend. 

Mobile Application – that is responsive 
 

# Software: 

Visual Studio Code (with the necessary plugins) - Frontend Development 

Postman – visualising and testing API endpoints 

DBeaver - Database manager

Canva – logo design 

Sonarcloud - code review tool (works with GitHub)

Microsoft Office – reports etc. 

Lucid chart – UML diagrams etc. 

Outlook and Microsoft Teams - Communicating with my project Supervisor
